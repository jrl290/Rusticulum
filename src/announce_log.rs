//! Announce log filter + periodic summary.
//!
//! Reticulum networks are extremely chatty: every node re-broadcasts every
//! announce it sees, so a transport-enabled node like rfed easily ingests
//! 1000+ announces/min. Logging every "Inbound ANNOUNCE / Announce VALID /
//! Path added" line at LOG_NOTICE used to dominate the log file and serialise
//! through the global `LOGGING_LOCK` + file-write on every packet.
//!
//! This module provides:
//!   1. A hardcoded whitelist of destination hashes we actually care about
//!      (rfed's own four destinations, the lxmf.propagation node, etc).
//!   2. Atomic counters that aggregate the suppressed traffic.
//!   3. `flush_if_due()` — call from any frequently-hit code path; emits a
//!      single summary line every `FLUSH_INTERVAL_SECS` seconds.
